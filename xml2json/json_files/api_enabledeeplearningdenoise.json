    "description": "Enables or disables deep-learning noise reduction.Since\n  v3.3.0\n       \n   \n   The SDK enables traditional noise reduction mode by default to reduce most of the stationary background noise. If you need to reduce most of the non-stationary background noise, Agora recommends enabling deep-learning noise reduction as follows:\n       Ensure that the dynamic library is integrated in your project: libagora_ai_denoise_extension.dll\n       Call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true).\n   \n   Deep-learning noise reduction requires high-performance devices. The deep-learning noise reduction is enabled only when the device supports this function. For example, the following devices and later models are known to support deep-learning noise reduction:\n       iPhone 6S\n       MacBook Pro 2015\n       iPad Pro (2nd generation)\n       iPad mini (5th generation)\n       iPad Air (3rd generation)\n   \n   After successfully enabling deep-learning noise reduction, if the SDK detects that the device performance is not sufficient, it automatically disables deep-learning noise reduction and enables traditional noise reduction.\n   If you call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true) or the SDK automatically disables deep-learning noise reduction in the channel, when you need to re-enable deep-learning noise reduction, you need to call leaveChannel first, and then call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true).\n   \n       This method dynamically loads the library, so Agora recommends calling this method before joining a channel.\n       This method works best with the human voice. Agora does not recommend using this method for audio containing music.",
