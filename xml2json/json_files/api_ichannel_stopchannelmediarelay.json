Once the relay stops, the host quits all the destination channels.After a successful method call, the SDK triggers the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE_CHANGED callback. If the callback reports RELAY_STATE_IDLE(0) and RELAY_OK(0), the host successfully stops the relay.\n   If the method call fails, the SDK triggers the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE_CHANGED callback with the RELAY_ERROR_SERVER_NO_RESPONSE(2) or RELAY_ERROR_SERVER_CONNECTION_LOST(8) status code. You can call the leaveChannel method to leave the channel, and the media stream relay automatically stops.",
