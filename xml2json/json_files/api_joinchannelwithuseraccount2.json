    "description": "Joins the channel with a user account, and configures whether to automatically subscribe to audio or video streams after joining the channel.Since\n  v3.3.0\n       \n   \n   This method allows a user to join the channel with the user account. After the user successfully joins the channel, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:\n  The local client: LOCAL_USER_REGISTERED, JOINED_CHANNEL and the CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED callbacks.\n  The remote client: The USER_JOINED callback if the user is in the COMMUNICATION profile, and the USER_INFO_UPDATED callback if the user is a host in the LIVE_BROADCASTING profile.\n       \n   Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the mute methods accordingly.\n   To ensure smooth communication, use the same parameter type to identify the user. For example, if a user joins the channel with a user ID, then ensure all the other users use the user ID too. The same applies to the user account. If a user joins the channel with the Agora Web SDK, ensure that the uid of the user is set to the same parameter type.",
