    "description": "Enables built-in encryption with an encryption password before users join a channel.Do not use this method for CDN live streaming.\n  For optimal transmission, ensure that the encrypted data size does not exceed the original data size + 16 bytes. 16 bytes is the maximum padding size for AES encryption.\n       \n   \n        Before joining the channel, you need to call this method to set the secret parameter to enable the built-in encryption. All users in the same channel should use the same secret. The secret is automatically cleared once a user leaves the channel. If the secret is not set or secret is set as null, the built-in encryption is disabled.\n   \n       \n  Deprecated:\n  Deprecated as of v3.1.0. Please use the enableEncryption method instead.",
