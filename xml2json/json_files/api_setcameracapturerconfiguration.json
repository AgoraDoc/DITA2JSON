    "description": "Sets the camera capture configuration.For a video call or the interactive live video streaming, generally the SDK controls the camera output parameters. When the default camera capturer settings do not meet special requirements or cause performance problems, we recommend using this method to set the camera capturer configuration:\n                    If the resolution or frame rate of the captured raw video data is higher\n                        than those set by setVideoEncoderConfiguration, processing\n                        video frames requires extra CPU and RAM usage and degrades performance.\n                        Agora recommends setting the camera capture configuration as CAPTURER_OUTPUT_PREFERENCE_PERFORMANCE (1) to avoid such\n                        problems.\n                    If you do not need a local video preview or are willing to sacrifice preview\n                        quality, we recommend setting the camera capturer configuration as CAPTURER_OUTPUT_PREFERENCE_PERFORMANCE (1) to optimize CPU\n                        and RAM usage.\n                    If you want better quality for the local video preview, we recommend setting\n                        the camera capturer configuration as CAPTURER_OUTPUT_PREFERENCE_PREVIEW(2).\n                    To customize the width and height of the video image captured by the local camera, set the camera capture configuration as CAPTURER_OUTPUT_PREFERENCE_MANUAL(3).\n                \n            \n   Call this method before calling joinChannel, enableVideo, or enableLocalVideo, depending on which method you use to turn on your local camera.",
