    "description": "Sets parameters for SDK preset audio effects.Since\n  v3.2.0\n       \n   \n   Call this method to set the following parameters for the local user who sends an audio stream:\n  3D voice effect: Sets the cycle period of the 3D voice effect.\n  Pitch correction effect: Sets the basic mode and tonic pitch of the pitch correction effect. Different songs have different modes and tonic pitches. Agora recommends bounding this method with interface elements to enable users to adjust the pitch correction interactively.\n       \n   \n   After setting the audio parameters, all users in the channel can hear the effect.\n   \n       \n  You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.\n  To get better audio effect quality, Agora recommends calling setAudioProfile and setting the scenario as AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING (3) before calling this method.\n  Do not set the profile parameter in setAudioProfile to AUDIO_PROFILE_SPEECH_STANDARD(1) or AUDIO_PROFILE_IOT (6), or the method will not take effect.\n  This method works best with the human voice. Agora does not recommend using this method for audio containing music.\n  After calling setAudioEffectParameters, Agora recommends not calling the following methods, because they can override setAudioEffectParameters:\n setAudioEffectPreset\n setVoiceBeautifierPreset\n setLocalVoiceReverbPreset\n setLocalVoiceChanger\n setLocalVoicePitch\n setLocalVoiceEqualization\n setLocalVoiceReverb\n setVoiceBeautifierParameters\n          setVoiceConversionPreset",
