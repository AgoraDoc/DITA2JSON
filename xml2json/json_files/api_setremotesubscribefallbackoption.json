    "description": "Sets the fallback option for the remote video stream based on the network conditions.Unreliable network conditions affect the overall quality of the interactive live streaming. If option is set as STREAM_FALLBACK_OPTION_VIDEO_STREAM_LOW(1) or STREAM_FALLBACK_OPTION_AUDIO_ONLY(2), the SDK automatically switches the video from a high stream to a low stream or disables the video when the downlink network conditions cannot support both audio and video to guarantee the quality of the audio. The SDK monitors the network quality and restores the video stream when the network conditions improve. When the remote video stream falls back to audio-only or when the audio-only stream switches back to the video, the SDK triggers the REMOTE_SUBSCRIBE_FALLBACK_TO_AUDIO_ONLY callback.\n               Ensure that you call this method before joining a channel.",
