    "description": "Occurs when a remote user (COMMUNICATION)/ host (LIVE_BROADCASTING) leaves the channel.There are two reasons for users to become offline:\n                    Leave the channel: When a user/host leaves the channel, the user/host sends a goodbye message. When this message is received, the SDK determines that the user/host leaves the channel.\n                    Drop offline: When no data packet of the user or host is received for a certain period of time (20 seconds for the communication profile, and more for the live broadcast profile), the SDK assumes that the user/host drops offline. A poor network connection may lead to false detections. It's recommended to use the Agora RTM SDK for reliable offline detection.\n                \n            \n        The callback for the second instance.",
