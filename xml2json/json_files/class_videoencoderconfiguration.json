You can also choose from the following options:\n      \n  : (Recommended) Standard bitrate mode In this mode, the video bitrate of the LIVE_BROADCASTING profile is twice that of the COMMUNICATION profile.\n : Adaptive bitrate mode In this mode, the bitrate differs between the LIVE_BROADCASTING and COMMUNICATION profiles. If you choose this mode in the LIVE_BROADCASTING profile, the video frame rate may be lower than the set value.\n      \n      Agora uses different video codecs for different profiles to optimize user experience.
