After setting an audio effect, all users in the channel can hear the effect. You can set different audio effects for different scenarios. See Set the Voice Beautifier and Audio Effects.\n            To achieve better audio effect quality, Agora recommends that you call setAudioProfile and set the profile to AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY(4) or AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO(5) and scenario to AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING(3) before calling this method.\n            \n                \n                    You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.\n                    Do not set the profile parameter in setAudioProfile to AUDIO_PROFILE_SPEECH_STANDARD(1)\n                    This method works best with the human voice.
