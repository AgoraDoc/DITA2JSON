This method applies to massively multiplayer online games, such as Battle Royale games.\n   \n       \n  For this method to work, enable stereo panning for remote users by calling the enableSoundPositionIndication method before joining a channel.\n  This method requires hardware support. For the best sound positioning, we recommend using a stereo speaker.\n  Call this method after joining a channel.",
