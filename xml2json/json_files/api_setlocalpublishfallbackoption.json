    "description": "Sets the fallback option for the published video stream based on the network conditions.An unstable network affects the audio and video quality in a video call or interactive live video streaming. If option is set as STREAM_FALLBACK_OPTION_AUDIO_ONLY(2), the SDK disables the upstream video but enables audio only when the network conditions deteriorate and cannot support both video and audio. The SDK monitors the network quality and restores the video stream when the network conditions improve. When the published video stream falls back to audio-only or when the audio-only stream switches back to the video, the SDK triggers the LOCAL_PUBLISH_FALLBACK_TO_AUDIO_ONLY callback.\n   \n       \n  Agora does not recommend using this method for CDN live streaming, because the remote CDN live user will have a noticeable lag when the published video stream falls back to STREAM_FALLBACK_OPTION_AUDIO_ONLY(2).\n  Ensure that you call this method before joining a channel.",
