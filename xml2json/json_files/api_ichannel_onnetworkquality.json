This parameter is a quality rating helping you understand how well the current uplink network conditions can support the selected video encoder configuration. For example, a 1000 Kbps uplink network may be adequate for video frames with a resolution of 640 × 480 and a frame rate of 15 fps in the LIVE_BROADCASTING profile, but might be inadequate for resolutions higher than 1280 × 720.
