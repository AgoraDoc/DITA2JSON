    "description": "Starts an audio device loopback test.This method tests whether the local audio capture device and playback device are working properly. After calling this method, the audio capture device records the local audio, and the audio playback device plays the sampled audio. The SDK triggers two independent AUDIO_VOLUME_INDICATION callbacks at the time interval set in this method, which reports the volume information of the sampling device (uid = 0) and the volume information of the playback device(uid = 1) respectively.\n   \n       Ensure that you call this method before joining a channel.\n       This method tests local audio devices and does not report the network conditions.",
