    "description": "Leaves a channel.This method releases all resources related to the session. This method call is asynchronous, and the user has not left the channel when the method call returns.\n   After calling joinChannel, you must call leaveChannel to end the call, otherwise the next call cannot be started.\n   A successful call of this method triggers the following callbacks:\n                    The local client: LEAVE_CHANNEL.\n                    The remote client: USER_OFFLINE, if the user joining the channel is in the communication profile, or is a host in the live streaming profile.\n                \n   \n       \n  If you call the leaveChannel method immediately after calling release, the SDK will not be able to trigger the LEAVE_CHANNEL callback.\n  If you call the leaveChannel method during a CDN live streaming, the SDK automatically calls the removePublishStreamUrl method.",
