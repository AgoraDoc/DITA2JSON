    "description": "Starts relaying media streams across channels. This method can be used to implement scenarios such as co-host across channels.After a successful method call, the SDK triggers the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE and CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_EVENT callbacks, and these callbacks return the state and events of the media stream relay.\n  If the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE callback returns RELAY_STATE_RUNNING(2) and RELAY_OK(0), and the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_EVENT callback returns RELAY_EVENT_PACKET_SENT_TO_DEST_CHANNEL(4), it means that the SDK starts relaying media streams between the source channel and the destination channel.\n  If the CHANNEL_MEDIA_RELAY_STATE callback returns RELAY_STATE_FAILURE(3), an exception occurs during the media stream relay.\n       \n   \n   \n       \n  Call this method after joining the channel.\n  This method takes effect only when you are a host in a live streaming channel.\n  After a successful method call, if you want to call this method again, ensure that you call the stopChannelMediaRelay method to quit the current relay.\n  Contact support@agora.io (https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) before implementing this function.\n  We do not support string user accounts in this API.",
