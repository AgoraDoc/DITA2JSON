The SDK requires the application to take action or informs the user about the issue. For example, the SDK reports an ERR_START_CALL error when failing to initialize a call. The app informs the user that the call initialization failed and invokes the leaveChannel method to leave the channel.\n    The callback for the second instance.\n            The callback only reports errors in the C++ layer.
